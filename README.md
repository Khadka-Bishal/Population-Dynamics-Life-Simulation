# Population-Dynamics-Life-Simulation
This is a graphical simulation of Conway’s Game of Life and the population dynamics of goats and plants. 

## Details

🌱 Conway's Game of Life Simulation:
   - Developed a graphical simulation of Conway's Game of Life in Java.
   - Implemented the rules of the Game of Life to simulate the evolution of cell populations.

🐐 Population Dynamics Simulation:
   - Extended the project to simulate the population dynamics of goats and plants, building upon existing code and concepts.
   - Modeled the interactions and behaviors of goats and plants within the simulation.

🖥️ User Interface Enhancement:
   - Added a simulation advancement button for controlling the progression of the simulation.
   - Integrated a real-time counter to display the population counts of goats and plants.

📊 Data Visualization:
   - Utilized Java Graphics for visualizing the simulation, including the representation of cells, goats, and plants.
   - Presented the simulation results and population dynamics using graphical elements.
